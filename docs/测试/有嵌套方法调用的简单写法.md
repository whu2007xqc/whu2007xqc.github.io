I have got 4 classes lets says A, B, C, D each calling on methods from another one.

now I have mocked class A, and want to mock a method using mockito

`A a = Mockito.mock(A.class);`  
and want to get "foo" on recursive method calls like  

a.getB().getC().getD() should return "foo"


解决方法：  
`A a = Mockito.mock(A.class, Mockito.RETURNS_DEEP_STUBS);`
